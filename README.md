# springboot-jwt-auth
This project demonstrates JWT-based authentication in Spring Boot for microservices. Users can register and login, receiving a Bearer token to access secured endpoints. Passwords are hashed, and requests are validated via JWT, providing secure, stateless authentication across services.
